Very nice job!
Suggestions:
+ Suggest encapsulating some of the logic in app.js into smaller functions
+ Suggest creating an adapter to handle ajax queries throughout.
+ Other controllers are pretty good overall.
+ Suggest writing smaller functions to encapsulate the more complicated logic, like parsing data
